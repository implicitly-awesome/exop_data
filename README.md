# ExopData

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/madeinussr/exop_data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/madeinussr/exop_data)

The goal of this library is to help you to write property-based tests by utilizing the power of Exop and [StreamData](https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data)
If you already use [Exop](https://github.com/madeinussr/exop) it is super easy.
Even if you haven't had Exop in your project yet you can use ExopData - just need to provide
a desirable params description (contract) that conforms Exop operation's contract format (the list of `%{name: atom(), opts: keyword()}`).

Here is the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/madeinussr/exop_data/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
